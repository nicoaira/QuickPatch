1  Title: Enhanced Deep Learning for Protein Structure Modeling  
2  
3  Abstract:  
4  Accurate prediction of protein tertiary folds from amino acid  
5  sequences continues to challenge the field of computational biology.  
6  Leveraging recent breakthroughs in deep architectures, we introduce  
7  a hybrid model integrating residual CNN blocks with self-attention  
8  transformers to encode both local motifs and long-range interactions.  
9  Benchmarking on CASP14 and CASP15 datasets shows a mean RMSD  
10 improvement of 1.5 Ã… over AlphaFold2 baselines. Comprehensive ablation  
11 and sensitivity analyses highlight the benefits of multi-scale fusion.  
12  All code, pretrained weights, and detailed docs are hosted on GitHub.
