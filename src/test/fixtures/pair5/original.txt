1  The old lighthouse stood silent against the raging storm.  
2  Waves crashed like thunder on the jagged rocks below.  
3  Inside, Keeper Marlow tended the lamp with weary hands.  
4  Lightning illuminated the dank chamber in fleeting flashes.  
5  He recalled calmer nights when ships passed safely by.

7  A sudden knock echoed through the corridor.  
8  Marlow’s heart pounded—no visitor dared approach in such weather.  
9  Gathering his courage, he opened the heavy oak door.

11 Rain lashed the threshold as a drenched stranger staggered in.  
12  She collapsed, clutching a rolled parchment.  
13  “You must deliver this to Shoreham,” she whispered.  
14  Marlow draped a blanket around her trembling shoulders.

16  Outside, the tempest raged on without mercy.  
17  The lamp’s glow wavered as the power flickered.  
18  Marlow braced himself for the long night ahead.  
19  
20  Dawn would bring answers—if they survived.
