1  Title: Deep Learning for Protein Structure Prediction  
2  
3  Abstract:  
4  Predicting protein tertiary structure from primary sequence remains  
5  a grand challenge in computational biology. Recent advances in deep  
6  neural networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in modeling  
7  residue–residue distances and angles. We propose a novel architecture  
8  combining convolutional and transformer layers to capture local and  
9  global sequence features. Our method outperforms existing models on  
10 CASP14 benchmarks, reducing RMSD by 1.2 Å on average. Ablation studies  
11 demonstrate the impact of multi‐scale feature fusion. Code and  
12 trained models are available at our GitHub repository.
