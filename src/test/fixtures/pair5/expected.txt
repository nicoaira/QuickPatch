2  Waves struck the cliffs like angry beasts below.  
3  Inside, Keeper Marlow polished the glass with trembling hands.  
4  Thunderbolts flashed across the dank chamber without warning.  
5  He longed for the peaceful nights when vessels passed unharmed.

7  A muffled rap sounded deep in the corridor.  
8  Marlow’s pulse quickened—no soul ventured out in such fury.  
9  Summoning resolve, he unlatched the heavy oak door.

16  Beyond the walls, the tempest showed no mercy.  
17  The lamp’s flame flickered with every gust of wind.  
18  Marlow steeled himself against the unforgiving night.

20  Only dawn would reveal their fate—if dawn ever came.
